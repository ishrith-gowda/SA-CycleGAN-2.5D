# Fidelity Is Not Utility: A Controlled Dissociation in Learned Image Translation

**Target venue:** ICLR 2026 (deadline ~Sept 24) / NeurIPS D&B track.
**Status:** working draft. The driving results are the publication-grade N=1000 / 3-seed run (NVIDIA A30,
GPU eval), including the structure-preserving (ControlNet-Canny) baseline; the medical results are final.
No `[TODO-node]` items remain. Do not treat this as camera-ready.

## Abstract

Generative image translation — harmonization, style transfer, synthetic-to-real adaptation — is
almost universally evaluated with *distributional fidelity* metrics such as FID. We show, in a
controlled setting, that **improving fidelity does not imply improving downstream utility, and for
learned translation the two systematically trade off.** Holding a downstream model *frozen*, we
measure both a fidelity axis (FID to the target domain) and a utility axis (task metric of the frozen
model) for the same inputs. Across two domains (synthetic-to-real driving and multi-site brain-tumor
MRI) and two generative families (adversarial CycleGAN and diffusion SDEdit), learned translation
lowers FID while degrading the downstream task metric, whereas a non-learned baseline (histogram /
color transfer) preserves the task metric without improving FID. Using SDEdit's noise-strength
parameter as a continuous knob, we trace a monotonic FID–utility frontier: no learned setting reaches
the high-fidelity, high-utility region, and no learned setting Pareto-dominates the non-learned
baseline. An empty-prompt ablation shows the utility loss persists even when fidelity is *not*
improved, isolating the effect to the learned generative prior rather than any conditioning signal.
Our contribution is not a new method but a **measurement**: a general, architecture-agnostic
dissociation between what fidelity metrics reward and what downstream tasks need.

## 1. Introduction

Distribution-matching translation is trained and evaluated to make outputs *look like* a target
domain. The implicit promise is that looking more like the target makes the outputs more *useful* —
e.g. that harmonizing site B to site A helps a model trained on A. We test that promise directly and
find it false for learned translation.

**Contributions.**
1. A **controlled protocol** for separating fidelity from utility: a frozen downstream evaluator plus
   a matched non-learned control, measuring FID and the task metric on identical inputs.
2. Evidence that the fidelity–utility dissociation is a property of the **learned distribution-matching
   objective**, not a single architecture — it reproduces under both a GAN (CycleGAN) and a diffusion
   model (SDEdit).
3. A **continuous characterization** via SDEdit strength: a monotonic FID-vs-mIoU frontier, with the
   ideal (low-FID, high-utility) corner empty, and an empty-prompt ablation decoupling utility loss
   from fidelity gain.
4. Cross-domain generality: the same dissociation in driving scenes and in clinical brain-tumor MRI.

## 2. Related Work

We situate three separately-established observations and unify them (full citations in
`related_work_and_positioning.md`).

- **Fidelity metrics mis-rank generators for downstream tasks.** Konz et al. (2024) show no perceptual
  metric reliably tracks segmentation quality in medical translation; CheXGenBench (2025) shows low FID
  does not predict clinical utility; the FID-critique line (Kynkäänniemi et al., ICLR 2023) shows FID is
  gameable. These are *metric-evaluation* studies; we add a learned/non-learned control and a second
  generative family and domain.
- **Distribution-matching translation alters task content.** Cohen et al. (MICCAI 2018) show CycleGAN
  hallucinates/removes tumors to match class balance; semantic-consistency losses (CyCADA, ICML 2018;
  Peng et al., ICCV 2023) exist precisely to patch this. We show that *without* such non-distributional
  anchoring the pure learned objective degrades utility, reframing those losses as evidence for our thesis.
- **Non-learned alignment rivals learned translation for segmentation DA.** FDA (Yang & Soatto, CVPR
  2020) reaches strong segmentation adaptation with a non-learned spectral swap. We use histogram/color
  transfer as the analogous control and, unlike FDA, measure the fidelity axis explicitly to expose the
  dissociation.

**Positioning.** No prior work runs the clean 2×2 {learned, non-learned} × {fidelity↓?, utility↓?} as
its thesis, ties the failure to the objective across GAN *and* diffusion, and does so across driving and
medicine. This is a measurement/positioning contribution, not a new architecture.

## 3. Setup: separating fidelity from utility

Given source images `x` and a translation `T`, we evaluate `T(x)` on two axes:
- **Fidelity:** `FID(T(x), target)` via clean-fid (Parmar et al., CVPR 2022). Lower = closer to target.
- **Utility:** a *frozen* downstream model `f` (never retrained) applied to `T(x)`, scored against
  ground truth. Because `f` is fixed, any change in its score is attributable purely to `T`.

We compare four families of `T`: (i) **identity** (raw source, reference); (ii) **non-learned**
(histogram / color transfer); (iii) **learned-GAN** (CycleGAN); (iv) **learned-diffusion** (SDEdit at a
sweep of strengths). FID is compared only at equal sample size N (it is N-biased).

## 4. Experiments

### 4.1 Driving: GTA5 → Cityscapes

Frozen evaluator: SegFormer-b4 fine-tuned on Cityscapes (19 classes); utility = mIoU. N=1000 GTA5
images per condition, with the Cityscapes validation set (500 images) as the fixed FID reference,
identical evaluator + clean-fid (GPU) for all. SDEdit rows are mean ± std over 3 seeds {42,43,44}.

| condition | family | FID ↓ | mIoU ↑ | ΔmIoU vs raw |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| raw GTA5 | baseline | 137.2 | 0.380 | — |
| color match | non-learned | 165.9 | 0.363 | −0.018 |
| SDEdit strength 0.20 | diffusion | 145.1 ± 1.8 | 0.323 ± 0.003 | −0.057 |
| SDEdit strength 0.30 | diffusion | 133.1 ± 2.1 | 0.289 ± 0.002 | −0.092 |
| SDEdit strength 0.40 | diffusion | 116.4 ± 1.1 | 0.237 ± 0.003 | −0.143 |
| SDEdit strength 0.50 | diffusion | 100.3 ± 1.4 | 0.194 ± 0.005 | −0.187 |
| SDEdit strength 0.60 | diffusion | 90.8 ± 2.0 | 0.150 ± 0.001 | −0.231 |
| SDEdit strength 0.70 | diffusion | 88.0 ± 0.4 | 0.106 ± 0.001 | −0.274 |
| CycleGAN | learned-GAN | 65.5 | 0.167 | −0.214 |
| SDEdit 0.50, empty prompt | diffusion (ablation) | 154.2 ± 1.9 | 0.170 ± 0.003 | −0.211 |
| ControlNet-Canny (structure-preserving) | diffusion + edge cond. | 133.2 ± 0.3 | 0.221 ± 0.002 | −0.159 |

**Findings.** (a) Learned translation (CycleGAN and every SDEdit strength) lowers FID relative to raw
while collapsing mIoU by 15–72%; CycleGAN more than halves FID (137→65) at mIoU 0.167. (b) The
non-learned baseline does not improve FID yet preserves mIoU (−1.8%). (c) SDEdit strength traces a
**monotonic frontier** with tight seed variance (σ(mIoU) ≤ 0.005): as strength rises, FID falls (145→88)
and mIoU falls with it (0.323→0.106); no learned setting reaches the ideal (low-FID, high-mIoU) corner,
occupied only by raw/non-learned (Fig. `figures/frontier_seeds.pdf`). (d) **Empty-prompt ablation:** with
no text prompt, FID is *worse* than raw (154.2 > 137.2) yet mIoU still collapses (0.170) — the utility
loss is the diffusion img2img prior itself, not text guidance, and occurs even absent any fidelity gain.
These are the publication-grade numbers (N=1000, 3 seeds, GPU eval on an NVIDIA A30); an earlier local
N=200 run reproduced the same ordering on an independent machine. (e) **Structure-preserving baseline.**
Conditioning the diffusion generator on the source image's Canny edges (ControlNet-Canny) does *not*
rescue utility: it lands on the learned frontier (FID 133.2, mIoU 0.221 ± 0.002) — in fact Pareto-dominated
by SDEdit at equal FID (SDEdit 0.30: FID 133.1, mIoU 0.289) — nowhere near the ideal corner. Edge-level
structure is not the task-relevant signal; only conditioning on the *segmentation map itself* (label-guided
diffusion, e.g. Peng et al. ICCV 2023) recovers utility, and only by injecting the labels — precisely the
non-distributional constraint our thesis says is required. This preempts "why not condition on structure?"
empirically: generic structural conditioning is insufficient.

### 4.2 Medical: multi-site brain-tumor MRI

Frozen evaluator: nnU-Net trained on BraTS, frozen; utility = tumor Dice on the external UPenn-GBM site
(n=103). Learned harmonizer: SA-CycleGAN-2.5D (self-attention CycleGAN, 2.5D, 4 modalities).

| input to frozen nnU-Net | family | Dice (foreground mean) |
|---|---|---:|
| BraTS test (in-domain ref) | — | 0.771 |
| UPenn raw (external) | baseline | 0.682 |
| UPenn + histogram match | non-learned | 0.669 |
| UPenn + learned harmonization | learned-GAN | 0.064 |
| UPenn + symmetric seg-consistency | learned-GAN (+content loss) | 0.205 |

**Findings.** Learned harmonization collapses external-site Dice (0.682 → 0.064) even though it makes the
images more source-like; the non-learned baseline preserves it (0.669). Content/segmentation-consistency
losses reduce but do not eliminate the loss (0.205 ≪ 0.682), consistent with the driving result that the
degradation is intrinsic to the learned objective. A second external site (RHUH-GBM, n=40) confirms the
direction (Dice 0.718 → 0.599 after harmonization, −16.6%).

> Note (two evaluation protocols): the numbers above use the frozen independent nnU-Net (the unbiased
> test). A separate method-development evaluator ranks symmetric seg-consistency as the best-preserving
> *learned* harmonizer; that belongs to the companion method paper, not this measurement paper. Keep the
> two protocols distinct when quoting.

## 5. Analysis

The learned objective optimizes appearance under a distribution/adversarial or denoising target with no
term guaranteeing task-relevant signal survives; SDEdit strength is exactly the amount of learned prior
injected, and utility falls monotonically with it. The empty-prompt result decouples utility loss from
fidelity gain: passing through the prior damages task content even when the output is *less* target-like.
Non-learned transforms, lacking a learned prior, cannot introduce this failure.

## 6. Limitations

- FID is N-biased; all conditions use the same N (1000 translated vs the 500-image Cityscapes val set as
  the fixed reference), and SDEdit points report mean ± std over 3 seeds (σ(mIoU) ≤ 0.005, σ(FID) ≤ 2.1),
  so the ordering is robust to both sample size and seed. A separate local N=200 run reproduces it.
- Two medical evaluation protocols exist; headline uses the frozen independent one.
- The structure-preserving baseline uses edge (Canny) conditioning; a segmentation-map-conditioned variant
  (label-guided diffusion) would recover utility only by injecting the labels, which concedes the thesis
  rather than refuting it. We report the edge variant as the honest "generic structure" control.

## 7. Conclusion

Fidelity is not utility. Rewarding distributional realism can actively harm the downstream task for
learned translation, across architectures and domains. We recommend reporting a frozen-evaluator utility
axis alongside any fidelity metric, and treating non-learned baselines as first-class controls.

## Reproducibility statement

All conditions regenerate from a single command (`scripts/run_generality_benchmark.sh`); seeds fixed and
logged; frozen evaluators referenced by checkpoint id (SegFormer-b4, nnU-Net); FID via clean-fid at fixed
N; code, configs, and the N=200 result set are released (`journal_extension/generality/`).
